# Spatial Data Manipulation

## a. Find the total number of road segments

Totally, there are 22,222 road segments in pgh_street shapefile.

## b. Calculate minimum, maximum, and mean segment lengths

The minimum segment length is 3e-04.  
The maximum segment length is 1.46654.  
The mean segment length is 0.05979852.  

## c. Filter out the segments that are below the mean length that you calculated in (b) and then create a map showing the remaining segments

# Spatial Data Aggregation

## a. Aggregate the data based on the mean of the point values. Create a map and prepare a report on the result

![](2.png)

Report: Let's call the map 'Area'. In this area, most cities located at center have a larger station mean value than remainings. Bottom center, left top, and right top areas have lower station mean values.

## b. Run regression on the point values before and after aggregation. Prepare a report on the result.

Regression Result:

Plot the result:

Explanation:

Let's call the values before aggregation 'Original Values' and values after aggregation 'Average Values'. From the summary of this regression. We can generate a formula: OriginalValues = -0.02601 * AverageValues + 49.04916. For example, if the AverageValues is 1, the OriginalValues will be predicted as 49.02315. If the AverageValues is 100, the OriginalValues will be predicted as 46.44816. As you can see from the plot above, low values will be averaged higher and high values will be averaged lower. This is how the mean works in statistics. When looking at the p-value in summary, it's 0.8738. Roughly speaking, when p-value > 0.10, there is little or no evidence against null hypothsis. In this case, x, the average values is not/less significant to predict the original values.
