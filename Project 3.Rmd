# 1. Autocorrelation

The Moran's I in the attribute Av8top is 0.2265501. Which means, the autocorrelation for attribute Av8top is positive, but not a strong autocorrelation because it's <0.3. More casely speaking, for Av8top, points/areas near each other are similar, but not very strong. 

# 2. Distance-Based Techniques

## 2.1 G, F, K, L functions plot for OilGasLocationPA

![](4.png)

For OilGasLocationPA, G rises sharply at short distances because many event have a very clode nearest neighbor. F rises slowly at first, but more rapidly at longer distances, because a good proportion of the study area is fairly empty. K rises up from 0, through distance 0, and then keep at a level for larger distances, which means clustered. L is above zero, there are more events than expected. So, generally, OilGasLocationPA is clustered.

## 2.2 G, F, K, L functions plot for IndustrialMineralMiningPA

For IndustrialMineralMiningPA, G rises sharply at short distances because many event have a very clode nearest neighbor. F rises slowly at first, but more rapidly at longer distances, because a good proportion of the study area is fairly empty. K rises up from 0, through distance 0. L is above zero, there are more events than expected. So, generally, OilGasLocationPA is clustered.

## 2.3 Compare G function for both dataset

![](9.png)

G function for OilGasLocationPA rises more sharply than IndustrialMiningPA. OilGasLocationPA is more clustered than IndustrialMineralMiningPA.

## 2.4 Compare F function for both dataset

![](10.png)

F function for OilGasLocationPA rises quicker than IndustrialMiningPA at short distances, but slower at larger distances. Which means, for OilGasLocationPA, there are more empty area.

## 2.5 Compare K function for both dataset

![](11.png)

At shorter distances, OilGasLocationPA rises quicker, which means there are more points clustered.

## 2.6 Compare L function for both dataset

![](12.png)

For both dataset, L is larger than 0, which means, there are more events than expected. IndustrialMiningPA, at shorter distances (around < 4000), exceed the expectation more than OilGasLocationPA.
