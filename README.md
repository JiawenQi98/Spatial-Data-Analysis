# Spatial-Data-Analysis
Projects code for the course I took in School of Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh

## Project 1
Spatial Data Aggregation.

## Project 2
Point Patterns Analysis: Regular and Random Quadrat Count Method.

## Midterm Project
Point Patterns Analysis: Random Quadrat Count Method, G and F function.

## Project 3
Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) and Distance-Based Techniques (G, F, K, and L functions).

## Project 4
Perform autocorrelation and local statistics among areas (polygons) of interest, perform global statistics and geographically weighted regression on spatial data, and apply spatial interpolation techniques to spatial datasets.

## Final Project
Spatial autocorrelation, interpolation and overlay analysis.
